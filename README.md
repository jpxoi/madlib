# Mad Lib

Basic Python program that uses user input to create a Mad Lib. This is a great way to learn about variables, data types, and input. A Mad Lib is a word game where players are prompted for one word at a time, and the words are eventually filled into the blanks of a word template to make an entertaining story!
